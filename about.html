  <h1>About ImageToolsPro</h1>

  <p>
    ImageToolsPro is an independent online platform created to help users manage image and PDF files easily.
    This website is built as a personal project with the goal of providing simple, fast, and reliable tools
    that work directly in the browser without requiring any software installation.
  </p>

  <p>
    I created ImageToolsPro after facing common problems like large image sizes, slow file uploads,
    and difficulty handling PDF documents online. Many available tools are either complicated,
    require signups, or are not beginner-friendly. This platform was designed to solve those problems
    by offering clean and easy-to-use tools that anyone can understand.
  </p>

  <p>
    ImageToolsPro is useful for a wide range of users including students, website owners,
    and general users who need quick solutions for compressing images, resizing files,
    or working with PDF documents. The tools are designed to save time, reduce file size,
    and improve overall productivity.
  </p>

  <p>
    This website is operated from India and aims to serve users globally. All tools are free to use
    and are focused on simplicity, privacy, and performance. Files are processed automatically,
    and user privacy is always respected.
  </p>

  <p>
    ImageToolsPro will continue to improve by adding more useful features and tools over time.
    The goal is to make file handling easier for everyone through a simple and accessible platform.
